Things to do:
	For pathfinding, store stations, depots, and tiles with more than 3 track connections as vertices
	Store each vertices shortest path to every direct other vertice
	Store waypoints as subvertices so that is kinda irrelavent
	
	The 2 connections is broken
	
	Add train pathfinding using direction, delete so it doesnt use visited
	Good through prev_tile incrementally, the closer index is to 0 the sooner it is
	Start with index 0 and see if direction works, if not, try index 1...
	
	Add unmovable and moveable vertices, stations/depots/3 connects vs endpoints
	
	Use dist to build expected time and compare that with the actual time to award different levels of money
	If adding two stops that have same coords, deleting one wont mess with the other
	Add Train Cars
	
	Add System to switch factories to make certain goods
	Add Units, high costs for standing armies
	Add Ai
